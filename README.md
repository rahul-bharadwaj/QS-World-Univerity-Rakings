# QS University Rankings

## Introduction -

University ranking is a measurable outcome of multiple factors that are considered to evaluate the standard of education, faculty, resources, and infrastructure. Every year, Universities are ranked by different organizations around the world like CWUR, Times Higher Education, Quacquarelli Symmonds (QS) and many others. We are using a dataset that contains rankings of the world universities as maintained by QS.
Quacquarelli Symmonds (QS) is a British think-tank company specializing in the analysis of higher education institutions throughout the world. It uses 6 factors for their ranking framework wiz. Academic Reputation, Employer Reputation, Faculty to Student Ratio, Number of Citations per Faculty, International Faculty, International Students. Another feature included in this data was Classification (which is not used for ranking) which included the institution's size, subject range, research intensity, age, and status.
This Data Exploration Project is an effort to answer some questions around the analysis of higher education institutions such as the following â€“

1. What factors other than rank is more desirable when deciding the quality of a University? In other words, how do Universities compare in terms of the 6 factors in QS factor classification?
2. Which Universities top in each of the specific factors?
3. Is there a correlation between different classification factors like Country, Age of the University, Reputation of the University, Size and International Student Numbers?
